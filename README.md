# flatfish

When was the last time you had to find a flatshare? SpareRoom really isn't cutting it? Now there's a better option: **FlatFish**
Instead of matching with a flat, you get matched with a flatmate. Like Tinder for flatmates, except this is a good idea. This novel algorithm finds you a compatible match, just like Dory finds Nemo.

ðŸŒŠ The landing page welcomes users with a soothing theme that reminds them of the ocean ðŸŒŠ

Just edit your details and upload a new photo. Users will want to put a face to the name, and adding a photo is a great way to humanise an otherwise impersonal activity. And if you just found out your parents lied about your date of birth, you can always come back and update here

Right now the user doesn't have any matches. This is because they haven't input any preferences.

Once the user has created an account or logged in, they can input their preferences for a flatmate and a flat. This page presents the biggest potential for extension - almost any flat or flatmate quality could hypothetically be added and used to match users with each other. If you're not familiar with the neighborhoods of Manchester, you can check them out on the map to the right. When the user is happy with their preferences, they can hit the single simple button to save their selections and get matches.

The custom algorithm "Piece of Carp" is the star of the show. Using a combination of rules and vector similarity, Piece of Carp matches compatible users and (even returns a score that can be used in the frontend to sort these matches). Before you see that, I just wanted you to see the relaxing loading page -> like a ripple in a river

Right now, we don't have any matches saved. Because there are plenty of fish in the sea, saving profiles lets you remember who the right fish are while you can always go back to update your preferences and find more options.

To avoid the hosting and moderation costs of a messaging system, Flatfish lets users link to their Instagram profiles to continue the conversation on Zuckerberg's dime .
After you have a convo with that person and you feel like it is no longer a match, just hit on the bin icon to remove that person from your list of potential flatmates for life.
